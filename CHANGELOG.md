### Changed

- **Breaking**: `runSpecAndExitProcess'` now takes named parameters
  `defaultConfig` and `parseCLIOptions`, allowing to specify, respectively, the
  default config and whether that config should be used as is or CLI options (if
  any provided) should be applied on top of it.
- Replaced `runSpecT` with `evalSpecT` as the former is now deprecated.

### Added

- Added comments where appropriate.
